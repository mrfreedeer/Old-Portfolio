# Portfolio of Juan Pablo Ospina Bustamante

These are the games I have developed since I started my undergraduate studies in 2015, to the present day:

* Tetris (2015)
* Pacman (2017)
* Wolverine - Beat'Em Up (2018)
* Distributed Parques (2019 for both Normal and Thick Client)

These games were developed as projects for different courses. I co-developed Pacman and Wolverine, the rest I developed alone.
